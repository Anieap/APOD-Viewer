## 📝 Note

The **NASA APOD API** is currently experiencing an **outage**, so live data cannot be fetched at this time.  
To preview the final output and app functionality, a **MockAPODService.swift** and a corresponding **apod_mock.json** file have been created and included in this project.  
These provide simulated API responses for testing and demonstration purposes until the API becomes available again.
